Lab 1 Programming
=================

`Main.c` is a "skeleton" solution to the programming lab questions. It contains
"holes" to be filled in, as well as support for very easy unit testing.

Extensive comments and examples are included in the `Main.c` file, along with
examples of string and memory manipulation. You can compile and run with a
command like:

```sh
gcc -o Main Main.c && ./Main
```
